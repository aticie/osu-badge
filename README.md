Well, here it is.

Some stuff that needs to be fixed before it can be used:
- **API LIMITATION: IT CAN ONLY GENERATE 10 IMAGES PER MINUTE. SEE [API DOCS](https://github.com/ppy/osu-api/wiki#apiget_replay). THE REPLAY IS MAINLY NECESSARY FOR THE GRAPH**
- Max combo is _**hardcoded**_
- Username is _**hardcoded**_
- Mods are _**hardcoded**_
- Map name, creator and diff are _**hardcoded**_
- placing of multi letter grades (SS, S+, SS+) is not that great
- diff and map creator's position is _**hardcoded**_
- pp position is not tested with small & big numbers
- background is not downloaded, blurred, cropped and dimmed automatically
- rendering should work headless, but I haven't tested it.
